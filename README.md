# TravellingSalesmanProblem

> Travelling Salesman Problem is the problem that asks the following question:
> "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?".

> This project shows the implementation of the visualisation of this problem in Python. 
> It uses mlrose package and solves the problem with genetic algorithm.

## How does it work

1. Run the code.
2. A graph with a map of Europe will show.
3. Click on the graph anywhere you'd like the cities for the Travelling Salesman Problem to be. Exit when you're done.
4. A graph with those cities, and the best solution (with TSP) for those cities will show.
